# Workflow Interface Based RPC

## Goal

- When running with an interpretor or running generated code, all features should be available.

## ToDo

- Figure out what `decideTypeId` in `RunRpcTestCase` does and see if there is a better way.
  - It is used to call `RegisterLocalObject`, unfortunately the current implementation can't make a local object tells the lifecycle what it type id is.
- `RpcLfiecycle` registered in reflection, because `IRpcLifecycle::GetController` returning itself causes problem in `RuntimeTest`
  - Without reflection registration, the metadata doesn't say it implements two interfaces at the same time.
- Verify `WfErrors::Cpp*`, probably not needed as errors should have been catched in eariler phases.
- `WfCpp_WriteReflection.cpp` is changed because `INVOKE(GET?)_INTERFACE_PROXY` does not handle overloading property. This should be a VlppParser bug. Fix the bug and revert this file.
  - https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Workflow/commit/7b0e54a1964774cbb011ea1e675aa8c72a3fbec4
- Continue to add more test cases until all features are covered.
  - Byval and byref collections.
    - A function accepts a byval or byref arguments, add one element, return it back as byval or byref arguments.
      - Byval -> byval.
      - Byval -> byref.
      - Byref -> byval.
      - Byref -> byref.
    - remote side will remember the object.
    - local side add another element.
    - check performed in boch local and remote side to see if side effects are visible or invisible as expected.
    - Including array, list, dictionary, observable list.
  - Simpler collection cases using property, testing if property attributes applied to both getter return values and setter arguments.
  - Collections of interfaces.
  - Collections of collections of primitive types.
  - Collections of collections of interfaces.
- C++ codegen for rpc data type JSON serialization.
- Solve interface inheritance and casting.
- Delete Runtime test category.
- Update `TestLibraryRpcByval.cpp` in `LibraryTest` to use `RpcDualLifecycleMock`, remove `RpcByvalLifecycleMock`.
  - Refactor `RpcDualLifecycleMock` to make it a common implementation for `GacUI`.
  - May need to refactor how to retrieve ops interfaces.

# Prompt

You must complete all following tasks. In order to make the work easier, when performing each task you should:
- Execute the task.
- Pass all unit test, fix any test failure including pre-existings.
- git commit and git push to the current branch.

Perform this per task, one after another, and only after all task is done:
- Run `..\Tools\Tools\Build.ps1 Workflow` for a complete CI.
- Pass all unit test, fix any test failure including pre-existings.
- git commit and git push to the current branch.

Perform each task like a new `# Repro`, which means when a task is done, you can wipe the `Copilot_Investigate.md` for the next task.

DO NOT ASK ME ANY QUESTION, I will not be watching you, you must make your best decision and run through the end.
